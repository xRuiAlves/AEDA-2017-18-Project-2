The project's goal was to use various non-linear containers (more specifically Binary Search Trees, Hash Tables and Priority Queues). 
</br></br>
The project's theme was to implement a platform to save records of different car crashes, storing information regarding the vehicle's brands, driver's names and to forward damaged vehicles to repair shops. The driver's were stored in a hash table, vehicle's brands in a Binary Tree and the repair shops were stored in a priority queue, which ordered the repair shops by their availability.
